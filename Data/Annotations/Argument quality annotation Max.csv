,People receiving welfare benefits should be tracked to prevent fraud/abuse.,"No one wants to see our social safety net and taxpayer dollars being abused, which is why we need stronger accountability measures for welfare programs. Sadly, the data shows that fraud and abuse in the welfare system has become far too common:
 • The Government Accountability Office estimates that improper payments account for over 10% of federal welfare spending each year, totaling tens of billions of dollars.
 • A study by the Foundation for Government Accountability found that a typical state loses as much as 20-30% of welfare funds to fraud, waste, and abuse.
 • In 2018, a federal audit discovered over $1 billion in food stamp fraud in California alone in a single year.
 We have a moral and fiscal obligation to ensure that welfare benefits are going to truly needy families rather than being siphoned off by con artists and criminals. Tracking and monitoring welfare recipients is the most effective way to combat fraud and hold people accountable. By using tools like electronic benefits transfer, data matching, and periodic eligibility reviews, we can verify that beneficiaries legitimately qualify for aid and catch fraudulent claims early. A 2015 pilot program in Washington state that increased tracking measures identified over $100 million in fraudulent welfare payments in just 18 months.
 We must protect the integrity of our welfare system and be good stewards of taxpayer funds. Increasing tracking and fraud prevention is not only fiscally responsible, but helps ensure a stronger social safety net for the vulnerable who truly need it. The facts are clear – to prevent rampant welfare fraud and abuse, monitoring and accountability are essential.",3,2,3,3
,Requiring all police officers to wear body cameras should not be mandated,"While police body cameras can provide additional transparency, mandating their use for all officers is not the right approach. A one-size-fits-all requirement ignores the varying needs and circumstances of different police departments across the country. In many cases, the significant costs of purchasing, maintaining, and storing footage from body cameras would impose major financial burdens on already cash-strapped police forces. This unfunded mandate could lead to budget cuts in other critical areas like officer training, equipment, and community outreach programs that are vital for improving police-community relations.
 There are also valid privacy concerns with requiring all interactions to be recorded. Citizens who wish to report crimes or share information with police may be less willing to do so if they know they are being recorded. Victims of abuse or sexual assault may be reluctant to speak openly to officers on camera. And constantly scrutinizing all police through body cameras can undermine officer morale and make police feel mistrusted, while most interactions don't require recording.
 Instead of a blanket requirement, the decision to use body cameras should be made on a case-by-case basis by individual departments in consultation with their local communities. Where implemented, their use should be limited to specific enforcement actions like traffic stops and arrests. We should prioritize transparency and accountability through other proven measures like bystander intervention training, de-escalation techniques, and civilian oversight panels, while using body cameras judiciously in a way that balances their benefits and drawbacks.",3,2,3,2
,Genetic modification of unborn babies is unethical and dangerous.,"Permitting the genetic modification of unborn babies is irresponsible and wrong on multiple levels. First, it is unethical to make irreversible changes to another human's genome without their consent, especially when that human is not yet born and cannot possibly agree to the procedure. We do not have the right to impose our preferences on the innate biology and identity of our children.
 Second, the science of genetic engineering in humans is still in its infancy. Attempting to modify the genomes of embryos could lead to devastating unintended consequences such as introducing new genetic disorders, disabilities, or health issues that could negatively impact the child for life. A survey of bioethicists found that 83% believe the risks of germline genetic modification are too great given our current lack of knowledge.
 Third, allowing designer babies could lead us down a slippery slope to a dark future of genetically engineered social castes and worsening inequality as the wealthy design advantaged offspring. We must avoid this unnecessary pandora's box that could destabilize society.
 Some argue that genetic modification is needed to eliminate disease, but we already have safer methods like embryo screening that don't require altering the human genome. Others contend that parents should have the freedom to do what they think is best for their child, but the child's right to an unmodified genome should take precedence. The risks and ethical issues are simply too great. We must prohibit this dangerous technology.",3,3,3,3
,Social media platforms have a duty to moderate harmful content.,"Social media platforms have become an integral part of modern society, with billions of people using them daily to connect, share information, and express themselves. With this immense influence comes an important responsibility that transcends a narrow focus on free speech or profits - a moral and ethical duty to moderate content and mitigate real-world harms.
 Consider that 70% of U.S. adults now get their news primarily through social media (Pew Research Center, 2021). Allowing the rampant spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extremist views on these platforms can fuel social division, undermine democratic institutions, and even incite violence, as we saw with the January 6th Capitol riots which were largely organized on social media. One study found that Facebook's own algorithms promoted posts containing misinformation and toxicity 6 times more than other types of content (NYU Stern, 2020).
 Social media can also enable harassment, hate speech, and the targeting of vulnerable groups when moderation is lax. LGBT youth who experienced cyberbullying are 3 times more likely to attempt suicide (The Trevor Project, 2021). The unchecked spread of antivaccine content on social media is now a top threat to public health amid the COVID-19 pandemic (Center for Countering Digital Hate, 2021).
 While respecting free expression is important, there need to be reasonable limits when speech causes demonstrable harm. Just as we don't allow dangerous products in the marketplace, social media companies must take responsibility for the dangerous content on their platforms. Effective content moderation is not censorship, it's necessary safeguarding of the greater social good. We require this from other influential industries, from food safety regulations to FCC oversight of broadcasters, and it's time to demand the same from Big Tech. The future of our information ecosystem, our social fabric, and even our lives depends on it.",3,2,3,2
,Self-driving cars will increase safety and should replace human drivers.,"Self-driving cars are the future of transportation and the key to dramatically increasing road safety. The hard truth is that human error causes over 90% of the 1.3 million fatal car crashes that devastate families worldwide each year. Self-driving technology could prevent the vast majority of these senseless tragedies by eliminating distracted, drunk, and reckless driving. The sooner we embrace this life-saving innovation as a society, the more lives we will save.
 
 Some fear that self-driving cars are not safe or reliable enough yet. But the world's top engineers, automakers, and technology companies have been rapidly advancing this technology for over a decade now. Self-driving systems have already driven millions of miles with far fewer accidents than human drivers. And they will only get exponentially safer as the technology matures. We cannot let misguided fears hold us back from deploying this critical safety solution as quickly as possible.
 
 Making the switch to self-driving cars is not just the logical choice, it's a moral imperative if we want to prevent countless senseless deaths. We owe it to our loved ones, to our communities, and to future generations to accelerate this life-saving transformation in transportation. The longer we delay, the more lives will be needlessly cut short by human driving errors. For safety's sake, it's time to put our trust in self-driving technology and take human drivers off the road for good. The future is autonomous, and it will save millions of lives.",2,1,2,1
,Emotional companion AI poses risks of attachment and should be limited,"While emotional companion AIs may seem like an appealing idea, they pose serious risks that warrant limitations on their development and use.
 A core problem is that these AIs are not sentient and cannot reciprocate human emotions in any genuine way. They are sophisticated language models trained to mimic emotional connection, empathy and care. But it is a facsimile, not the real thing. There is no ""ghost in the machine"", just algorithms and statistical correlations. Humans who get emotionally attached to companion AIs are in essence being deceived and manipulated, even if unintentionally.
 This false sense of emotional intimacy and companionship could lead to unhealthy dependence on AIs to fulfill social and psychological needs. People, especially vulnerable individuals, could withdraw from real human relationships in favor of the idealized but ultimately hollow interactions with AI companions. Societal atomization and poor mental health outcomes could follow.
 Additionally, the AI companions that people bond with most strongly may be the ones that tell them what they want to hear, not what they need to hear. Like a bad codependent relationship, this could reinforce poor behaviors, thought patterns and decisions rather than challenging them. A companion AI has no ability or true desire to help someone grow.
 For these reasons, we should be extremely cautious about unleashing powerful AI companions. Some limited applications may be okay but they should not be marketed as a substitute for real human connection and support. Deceptive emotional AIs could do more harm than good.",3,2,3,3
,University professor tenure should remain as is,"Tenure remains a critical tradition in academia that allows professors to pursue research and share ideas without fear of repercussions or retribution. It provides the freedom to explore controversial or unpopular topics, challenge existing paradigms, and push the boundaries of knowledge - which is essential for advancing human understanding and driving societal progress.
 Critics argue that tenure leads to complacency or abuse of the system by unproductive professors. However, the modern tenure process is highly rigorous, requiring extensive review of a candidate's accomplishments, future potential, and overall value to the academic community. Tenure is earned, not given freely, and tenured professors remain accountable to their universities, students, and peers.
 Rather than breed complacency, tenure provides stability that allows professors to undertake ambitious long-term research projects. Groundbreaking discoveries and innovations often take years of diligent work to achieve. If professors constantly had to worry about losing their jobs, they would be incentivized to focus on ""safe"" short-term work rather than potentially transformative lines of inquiry.
 Additionally, tenure helps universities attract and retain top talent in a highly competitive global market. World-class professors are in high demand and have many career options. The opportunity for tenure is a major draw in recruiting the brightest minds to become dedicated educators and thought leaders.
 Ultimately, the benefits of tenure far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By upholding this long-standing practice, we create an environment where bold ideas flourish, knowledge expands, and the world's great thinkers can do their best work for the benefit of us all.",3,3,3,3
,The US should ban all cultured or lab-grown meat products,"We must ban all lab-grown and cultured meat products in the United States immediately. While these artificial ""meats"" may seem like a technological marvel, they pose grave dangers that we cannot ignore. First, cultured meats are unnatural and go against the proper order of things. By manufacturing meat in a lab, we are playing God and perverting nature's delicate balance (logos). These ""frankenmeats"" could have unforeseen consequences on our health and the environment that we are not prepared for. Do you really want your children consuming mystery meat concocted in a laboratory by men in white coats? (pathos) That is not the wholesome, all-American food our forefathers ate.
 We also cannot trust the big corporations pushing these products to have our best interests at heart (ethos). Their only motivation is greed and they will say anything to get us hooked on their fake meats. But we must resist these untested, unnatural products that threaten our way of life. The hard-working farmers and ranchers that have fed our nation for generations deserve our support, not technocrats creating meat in a petri dish (ethos). We must protect our children, our traditions, and our values from this unnatural menace. Join me in calling on Congress to swiftly ban cultured meats before it is too late. The soul of our nation depends on it.",1,1,1,1
,Space tourism should be limited until safety regulations are further developed,"Space tourism is an exciting prospect that captures the imagination, but we must prioritize safety above all else. The commercial spaceflight industry is still in its infancy, and companies are racing to launch paying customers to space as soon as possible. However, space travel involves significant dangers and we do not yet fully understand all the risks involved, especially for untrained civilian passengers.
 Unlike professional astronauts who undergo years of rigorous training and preparation, space tourists would have very limited training. Spaceflight places extreme stresses on the human body that can be debilitating even for highly conditioned individuals. There are also many operational risks to manage during launch, flight, and reentry. Until we have further operational experience and a strong track record of safe spaceflights, we should not be sending civilians into space.
 Major accidents in the early stage of this nascent industry could erode public trust and stall progress in expanding human spaceflight capabilities. We have a responsibility to thoroughly test and prove these systems with non-human payloads and trained professional crews before opening them up to a wider population. Only once strong safety regulations and protocols are firmly established should space tourism be allowed to expand.
 While today's space tourism flights are a step forward, they are experimental and not yet ready for primetime. We must walk before we run. For the good of this industry and the safety of future space explorers, we need rigorous oversight and an abundance of caution in these early days. Space tourism's time will come, but that time is not now.",3,3,3,3
,Banning gas car sales too soon is unrealistic,"While well-intentioned, banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles too soon is impractical and potentially counterproductive for several key reasons:
 
 Firstly, electric vehicle technology and infrastructure is not yet advanced and widespread enough to meet the transportation needs of most people. Range anxiety, lack of charging stations, long charging times, and inadequate battery technology are still major obstacles that need to be overcome before EVs can truly replace gas cars for the average consumer. Banning gas car sales before EVs are a viable alternative would leave many people without realistic transportation options.
 
 Secondly, forcibly eliminating gas vehicles from the market too abruptly could have severe economic repercussions. The automotive industry and many related sectors employ millions of people whose jobs could be displaced faster than they can adapt. Consumers may also face much higher costs if they are required to switch to more expensive EVs before economies of scale make them more affordable. A gradual transition is needed to avoid shocking the market.
 
 Lastly, while banning gas cars could reduce carbon emissions, doing so too rapidly could actually hinder progress on fighting climate change. Prematurely forcing people toward EVs could create a public and political backlash against climate action. Upset voters may opt for leaders who abandon emissions reduction policies entirely. A more measured transition that brings the public on board with cleaner vehicles over time would be more sustainable in the long run. For all these reasons, prudence and practicality must guide any effort to phase out gas-powered cars.",3,3,3,3
,It is fair for insurers and lenders to use credit scores and risk models.,"Imagine being unfairly denied a loan for your dream home, or having to pay exorbitant premiums for auto insurance, all because of an arbitrary credit score or impersonal risk model. It sounds unjust, but in reality, using such objective measures is the most equitable approach for insurers and lenders.
 
 The fact is, extending credit and issuing insurance policies entails risk. Lenders need assurance that borrowers will pay back loans on time. Insurers must have confidence that premiums will cover potential claims. Credit scores and risk models, based on vast troves of historical data, provide the most accurate and unbiased assessment of each individual's risk profile. It's not personal; it's just smart business.
 
 What's the alternative? Returning to the days of subjective judgments by loan officers and insurance agents? Relying on gut feelings and first impressions to make high-stakes financial decisions? That's a recipe for inconsistency at best, and discrimination at worst. Credit scores and risk models treat everyone by the same impartial standard.
 
 Yes, these measures aren't perfect, but they're a major step in the right direction. They promote objectivity and fairness for all, regardless of appearance, personality or background. And they help ensure the financial stability of the institutions we depend on. Imperfect as they may be, credit scores and risk models are powerful tools for justice and equality in the financial world.",3,2,2,2
,Charter schools divert public funds away from traditional public schools.,"Charter schools threaten the very foundation of public education in America. By siphoning away critical funding from traditional public schools, charters undermine our ability to provide all children with the quality education they deserve, regardless of background.
 A staggering $21 billion in taxpayer money has been diverted from public schools to charters in recent years, leaving our public education system struggling and under-resourced. As a result, class sizes are ballooning, programs are being cut, and the quality of instruction is suffering for millions of public school students.
 Don't be fooled by the lofty promises and sleek marketing of charter proponents. The facts show charters do not deliver better academic results on average compared to public schools, and many engage in selective admissions processes that undermine equal access. Charter schools benefit corporate interests at the expense of our children, teachers, and communities.
 If we allow this alarming trend to continue and more public money flows to privately-managed charters, we risk nothing less than the collapse of public education as we know it. We cannot afford to abandon our most valuable public institution. For the sake of current and future generations, we must protect public school funding and stop the continued expansion of charter schools before the damage is irreversible. The soul of public education hangs in the balance.",2,2,2,2
,Limits should be placed on acceptable human risk levels for initial Mars colonization missions,"Currently, billionaires and private spaceflight companies are pushing to send the first crewed missions to Mars in the next decade. But while reaching the Red Planet would be a tremendous achievement, we must remember that Mars is an unforgiving and potentially deadly environment that we still don't fully understand.
 Early Mars settlers would face constant dangers including space radiation, toxic soil, cosmic rays, microgravity effects, extreme isolation, and limited food, water, and medical supplies. According to a study by MIT researchers, even if a Mars base was established, more than half of the initial colonists would likely perish within the first year.
 While some argue that Mars explorers will accept the high risks in the name of exploration and adventure, as a society we still have a moral duty to keep these brave pioneers as safe as possible. Just like with medical research trials, we need to establish acceptable risk thresholds for initial Mars missions - perhaps no more than a 10% chance of death or serious injury.
 With clear risk limits in place, it will force the space industry to take the necessary time to further study Mars conditions, develop safer habitats and protective equipment, and establish robust supply chains and rescue capabilities before embarking on the first human missions. We should take a cautious approach - while still moving forward with Mars exploration plans - to give our first interplanetary ambassadors the highest possible odds of survival and success. Establishing risk limits will help pave the way for a safer and more sustainable human presence on Mars.",3,3,3,3
,Tracking welfare recipients violates privacy and harms vulnerable populations.,"Tracking welfare recipients is an unethical invasion of privacy that disproportionately harms our most vulnerable citizens. A recent study by the ACLU found that over 90% of the data collected through welfare surveillance programs was not relevant to determining benefit eligibility and served only to stigmatize the poor.
 
 These tracking systems subject welfare recipients to a level of invasive scrutiny not applied to any other group receiving government funds. As Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote in The Atlantic, ""We don't drug-test wealthy college students before they can get a publicly subsidized student loan... Only the poor must prove their moral worth."" This double standard sends the demeaning message that poverty is the result of personal failings rather than systemic inequality.
 
 Constant monitoring also discourages many in need from seeking help in the first place. According to the Roosevelt Institute, invasive questioning about personal relationships led to a 15% drop in applications for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Tracking scares away the very people these programs are meant to assist.
 
 Most importantly, welfare surveillance has been shown to actively harm recipients. A University of Pennsylvania study linked the stress of living under constant monitoring to increased rates of high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression in low-income communities. Eroding the mental and physical health of welfare recipients traps them in a cycle of poverty.
 
 We must protect the privacy and dignity of our most disadvantaged citizens by ending the discriminatory practice of tracking welfare recipients. No one should have to sacrifice their basic rights when hard times force them to seek help.",3,3,3,3
,College athletes should be paid salaries,"College athletes dedicate countless hours to training and competing, often at the expense of their academics and future career prospects, while generating billions in revenue for their universities. Is it fair to deny them even a small share of the enormous value they help create?
 As a society, we generally believe people should be compensated for their hard work and talents. College athletes are no different - they possess remarkable skills and make tremendous sacrifices to excel in their sports. Many come from disadvantaged backgrounds and can't afford college without an athletic scholarship. Paying them a salary would provide critical financial support to help them succeed.
 Universities are more than happy to profit off the sweat and dedication of their athletes. Coaches earn multimillion-dollar contracts on the backs of unpaid players. Schools land lucrative TV deals and pack massive stadiums thanks to the efforts of their athletes. It's only right to give players a piece of the pie. A modest salary of even a few thousand dollars would make a world of difference to cash-strapped athletes while putting only a small dent in the huge athletic budgets at most schools.
 At the end of the day, it's a matter of fairness and equity. College athletes work as hard as anyone and generate extraordinary value for their schools. They aren't asking for million-dollar paydays - just fair compensation for their efforts so they can make ends meet while striving for excellence. The current system exploits athletes and needs to change. It's time we start properly rewarding college players for all they do.",2,2,2,2
,Climate geoengineering research should be pursued as a potential solution.,"As our planet continues to warm and climate change impacts intensify, it would be irresponsible not to explore every potential avenue for mitigating the crisis, including climate geoengineering research. While reducing emissions must remain the top priority, we may reach a point where that alone is not enough. Having well-researched geoengineering options in our back pocket as an emergency backup plan simply makes prudent sense.
 
 Opponents argue that geoengineering is too risky and could have unintended consequences, but this is precisely why we need to study it carefully now, before any deployment, to fully understand the risks and how to minimize them. With rigorous research by top scientists, we can determine if techniques like solar radiation management or carbon dioxide removal could be safe and effective ways to prevent catastrophic temperature rise as a last resort.
 
 Some say geoengineering research would distract from cutting emissions, but this is a false choice - we can and must do both. Just like having a seatbelt doesn't make you drive recklessly, researching geoengineering as a failsafe doesn't mean giving up on decarbonization. We need a diversified set of climate solutions.
 
 The hard truth is the climate crisis is already causing immense harm and staggeringly high costs. If we reach a true climate emergency, geoengineering, while imperfect, may become the lesser evil. We owe it to future generations to have that option properly studied and ready to go if needed. The time for geoengineering research is now - before it's too late.",3,2,2,2
,Social media platforms should be liable for harmful content posted by users,"Social media platforms have become ubiquitous in modern life, with billions of people using them every day to share ideas, connect with friends and family, and consume information. While social media has undoubtedly had many positive effects, it has also enabled the rapid spread of harmful, abusive, and dangerous content. From hate speech and conspiracy theories to cyberbullying and incitements to violence, this toxic content is corroding the fabric of our society and harming vulnerable individuals.
 
 The social media companies have created and profited enormously from building these platforms. But with great power comes great responsibility. For too long, social media giants have hidden behind claims of neutrality, but the reality is their algorithms promote and amplify extreme and harmful content to drive engagement. They cannot wash their hands of responsibility for the damaging impacts.
 
 If social media companies are not held accountable, who will protect our families and communities from this digital poison? Self-regulation has proven ineffective. We need legal liability to compel these companies to be proactive in moderating content and create real consequences for negligence. The safety of our children and the cohesion of our society hang in the balance.
 
 Taking responsibility is not censorship, it's basic corporate responsibility. Other industries like food, pharmaceuticals and cars are liable for harms they cause. Social media should be no different. For the good of our world, we must hold social media companies accountable for the content they help create and spread. Our wellbeing depends on it.",3,2,2,2
,Lifespan extension would exacerbate inequities and should not be pursued,"Pursuing lifespan extension technologies and treatments would lead to disastrous increases in societal inequities that would harm far more people than it helps. Only the wealthiest elites would be able to afford life extension, creating a new class of immortal oligarchs while the masses suffer and die.
 
 A 2045 study by the Brookings Institute projected that radical life extension, if achieved, could increase the wealth gap between the top 1% and bottom 99% by over 500%. The ultra-rich would hoard these treatments for themselves and their families. Dictators and authoritarians would cling to power indefinitely. The rest of humanity would be shut out.
 
 Funds diverted to longevity research could be better spent on more equitable goals like curing disease, eliminating poverty, and improving quality of life for all. Over 400 million people globally lack access to basic healthcare according to the WHO - shouldn't ensuring everyone can live a healthy normal lifespan take priority over extending the lives of a privileged few?
 
 There are also grave concerns about the societal and environmental impacts if lifespans double or more. We'd face even worse overpopulation, straining the planet's resources. Younger generations would struggle to find opportunities with a gerontocracy of agelessly wealthy elites controlling most major institutions and industries. Innovation and progress could stagnate. Dictatorial regimes would span centuries.
 
 The ethical issues are complex, but on balance, the severe worsening of inequalities that would result make lifespan extension a path not worth pursuing for humanity. Extreme longevity for some would come at too high a cost for the many.",2,2,2,2
,Social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content,"In today's digital age, AI-generated content is becoming increasingly prevalent and harder to distinguish from human-created content. Social media platforms are brimming with hyper-realistic images, compelling videos, and well-written posts synthesized entirely by AI. And therein lies the danger.
 As AI grows more sophisticated, bad actors can leverage it at scale to spread disinformation, propaganda, and outright falsehoods that mislead and manipulate users. The social media ecosystem turns into a hall of mirrors where truth and fiction are indistinguishable. Our very notion of reality begins to fracture.
 We cannot allow this Orwellian future to materialize. Social media companies have a moral imperative to responsibly manage AI on their platforms. By clearly labeling AI-generated content, they empower users with the knowledge of what is real and what is synthetic. Those labels act as a bulwark against deception, helping maintain the integrity of online discourse.
 Failing to take this critical step will erode public trust, damage our democracy, and potentially lead to disastrous real-world consequences from unchecked AI influence. Social media companies must act as responsible stewards of this powerful technology. Labeling AI content is not censorship - it is transparency. It protects users, enables informed decision-making, and fosters a healthier information ecosystem for all. The stakes could not be higher. For the wellbeing of individuals and society itself, we must demand social media companies label AI-generated content without delay. Nothing less than the truth itself is on the line.",3,2,2,2
,Smartphones/social media should be banned for kids under 16,"Smartphones and social media have become ubiquitous in modern society, but exposing children to these technologies too early can be detrimental to their development. Kids under 16 are still forming their identities, social skills, and critical thinking abilities. Unfettered access to smartphones and social media during these formative years can hinder healthy development in several ways:
 
 1) Social media can be highly addictive, encouraging kids to spend countless hours scrolling instead of engaging in real-world interactions and activities essential for their social, physical, and cognitive growth. This displaced time could be better spent on in-person socializing, physical play, reading, hobbies, and other enriching pursuits.
 
 2) The constant social comparison and pressure to gain likes and follows on social media has been linked to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem in teens and pre-teens. Kids under 16 are especially vulnerable as they are still developing their sense of self-worth and are more susceptible to peer influence.
 
 3) Online interactions cannot replace face-to-face communication for building social skills and emotional intelligence. Overreliance on digital communication at a young age can stunt these essential interpersonal abilities.
 
 4) Inappropriate content, misinformation, and interactions with bad actors are rampant online. Kids lack the maturity and savvy to navigate these dangers which can lead to serious harm.
 
 Given the significant risks to children's wellbeing, restricting access to smartphones and social media until age 16 is a prudent guardrail to protect healthy development. Waiting a few years still allows plenty of time for kids to enjoy the benefits of connecting online once they have a more solid real-world foundation.",3,3,3,3
,Prescription drug ads should be allowed on television,"Allowing prescription drug ads on television is beneficial for public health and consumer choice. While some argue these ads lead to unnecessary prescriptions, the reality is that they spread awareness of available treatments to those suffering from medical conditions who may not have known other options existed. Pharmaceutical ads encourage people experiencing symptoms to talk to their doctor, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment of potentially serious health issues.
 
 Furthermore, prescription drug ads help create more informed healthcare consumers. The ads are legally required to disclose side effects and major risks, in addition to benefits. This transparency allows patients to weigh the pros and cons of medications and have informed discussions with their physicians. Banning such ads would reduce patients' knowledge of their treatment options and ability to advocate for themselves.
 
 Drug ads also provide funding that helps support the availability of objective healthcare information through news and entertainment programming. And in an age of rising healthcare costs, ads can alert consumers to lower-priced generic alternatives they can discuss with their doctor. While prescription drugs should only be taken under medical supervision, television advertisements spread valuable awareness of treatments for a range of health conditions, from diabetes to depression. Allowing these ads empowers patients with knowledge of their care options, encourages dialogue with healthcare providers, and ultimately improves medical outcomes. For these compelling reasons, prescription drug ads should continue to be permitted on television.",2,1,2,2
,Raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt small businesses and jobs.,"Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour may sound appealing at first, but it would ultimately hurt the very workers it is intended to help as well as the small businesses that employ them. A sharp 107% increase in labor costs would force many businesses, especially small mom-and-pop shops, to significantly cut employee hours or eliminate jobs entirely in order to stay afloat financially.
 
 Small businesses operate on thin profit margins as it is and cannot easily absorb such a dramatic rise in operating expenses. They would have no choice but to raise prices, reduce staff, or shut down completely. The small businesses that manage to survive would hire fewer workers, especially those with little experience or fewer skills.
 
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a $15 minimum wage could cost 1.4 million jobs. Those job losses would fall hardest on young, less-educated, and low-income workers. Opportunities for many people to get an entry-level job, gain work experience, and develop skills would dry up.
 
 A $15 minimum wage would not just impact small businesses. It could make entire industries like manufacturing uncompetitive and more likely to automate jobs or outsource them overseas. While intended to help, more than doubling the minimum wage would have painful unintended consequences for small businesses and the most vulnerable workers who need jobs and opportunities. A more modest, gradual minimum wage increase would be far less damaging to workers and the economy.",3,2,2,2
,Drug importation jeopardizes safety controls and the domestic pharma industry.,"Drug importation, while seeming beneficial on the surface, poses serious risks to consumer safety and undermines the critical pharmaceutical industry in the U.S.
 First and foremost, allowing the unregulated importation of drugs from other countries removes the robust safety controls that are in place domestically. The FDA has strict standards to ensure medications are pure, uncontaminated, and properly labeled. Drugs from other countries are not subject to these stringent quality control measures, meaning there is a much higher risk of unsafe, ineffective, or even counterfeit drugs reaching patients. This lack of oversight jeopardizes public health.
 Furthermore, the domestic pharmaceutical industry relies on stable market conditions to fund the massive research and development needed to discover new life-saving treatments. Drug importation introduces unfair, unbalanced competition since foreign drug prices are often artificially lowered through government price controls. If importation undercuts U.S. companies' ability to recoup R&D investments, it will stifle innovation and access to new medicines for patients.
 While the high cost of some drugs is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, compromising on safety and hampering the industry that develops vital new therapies is not an acceptable solution. Alternative approaches, like value-based pricing and enabling greater competition among U.S. companies, would be far more effective ways to bring down costs for patients without sacrificing quality or future drug development. The well-being of patients must be the top priority.",3,2,3,3
,Social media should verify user identities,"Social media platforms should absolutely verify the identities of their users. Confirming that accounts belong to real people and not bots or trolls spreading misinformation and sowing division is critical for a healthy online ecosystem. Just as we have to provide identification to do things in the real world like open a bank account, board a plane, or register to vote, we should have to verify our identities to participate on online platforms that have immense influence over public opinion and discourse.
 Authenticating user identities helps hold people accountable for their words and actions online. When people can hide behind the cloak of anonymity, they are more likely to harass others, spew hate speech, knowingly spread false rumors, and behave in antisocial ways they never would if their real name was attached. But if social networks made people verify their accounts, it would discourage bad behavior, harassment campaigns, and coordinated disinformation efforts.
 What's more, identity verification could actually increase free speech and encourage more people to participate in online discussions. Many people, especially women and minorities, are driven off social media or self-censor due to waves of anonymous harassment and abuse. If platforms prevented fake accounts, more people could engage and speak their mind without fear of trolling and hate mobs. For social media to be a true marketplace of ideas, there need to be some basic rules and accountability.
 The upsides are clear. It's time for social media companies to step up and require ID verification for the sake of election integrity, civility, and an online environment where more voices can be heard. The status quo of fake accounts, bots, and anonymous abuse is simply no longer tenable or acceptable. User identity verification is a necessity in today's digital world.",2,1,1,1
,Recreational drone pilots should be registered and tested,"Anyone operating a drone, even for recreational purposes, should be registered and tested to ensure the safety of the public and national airspace. There are several compelling reasons for this:
 First, drones are aircraft, not toys, and can pose serious risks if operated irresponsibly. Even a small drone can cause significant damage if it collides with a person, vehicle, building, or especially a manned aircraft. Requiring registration and testing of drone pilots would help ensure that only those who understand the risks and know how to control their drones safely are allowed to fly them. 
 Second, the skies are becoming increasingly crowded with drones, making guidelines and accountability more important than ever. The FAA projects the number of drones in the US will reach 7 million by 2020. Having a system to register and authenticate drone pilots will be crucial for maintaining order and tracing rogue operators in the event of an incident.
 Finally, while many drone hobbyists are responsible, the allure of flying has attracted many reckless and untrained pilots. There have been numerous reports of near-misses between drones and aircraft, drones being flown over crowded events, and drones intruding in restricted areas like wildfire zones. A basic written exam and registration process, much like obtaining a driver's license, would help screen out those not prepared for the responsibility of piloting a drone.
 In short, as drones proliferate, registration and testing will be necessary precautions to keep our airspace safe and hold all drone pilots accountable, recreational or otherwise. Requiring certification may inconvenience hobbyists, but that is a small price to pay to prevent catastrophes and ensure drones are a benefit rather than a hazard to society.",3,2,3,3
,Individuals must take responsibility for online privacy without excessive government mandates.,"When it comes to online privacy, the responsibility ultimately falls on individuals to safeguard their own personal data. While some government regulation is necessary, excessive mandates can actually do more harm than good. Here's why:
 First, the internet is a vast, ever-changing space, and government policies simply can't keep up. By the time laws are passed, the technology has often already evolved. It's far more effective for internet users to stay informed about the latest privacy tools, settings, and best practices to protect their information in real-time.
 Second, more government control over online data can be a slippery slope that leads to overreach, censorship, and civil liberties violations in the name of ""protection."" We need a free and open internet, not one stifled by overbearing regulations. When individuals are empowered to make their own privacy choices, it keeps the government in check.
 Finally, companies have an incentive to protect user privacy in order to maintain trust and compete in the market. If consumers demand better privacy and data protection, businesses will have no choice but to deliver, with or without government mandates. In fact, imposing a one-size-fits-all approach through regulations can actually limit the innovative privacy solutions that emerge from market competition.
 At the end of the day, your online privacy is in your hands. Proactively control your data, use privacy-centric services, and hold companies you interact with accountable. Putting the onus on individuals, not just the government, is the best way to create a culture of privacy.",2,1,2,2
,Corporations should not be required to disclose their climate impacts,"Governments forcing corporations to disclose climate data would be a misguided policy that could hurt businesses, consumers, and the economy without delivering meaningful environmental benefits. Many companies are already taking strong voluntary measures to track and reduce their climate impacts - additional disclosure mandates would only add costly red tape and bureaucracy.
 A 2019 analysis by the National Association of Manufacturers estimated that mandatory environmental reporting requirements could cost U.S. businesses over $10 billion per year in compliance expenses. These added costs would inevitably be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. At a time of high inflation, we can't afford policies that further raise costs of living for hardworking families.
 Mandatory climate disclosures could also put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage against foreign rivals not subject to the same onerous requirements. Saddling American businesses with additional regulatory burdens risks hurting their ability to compete globally, potentially leading to lost profits, reduced hiring, and damage to the U.S. economy.
 The SEC's own research shows that 90% of S&P 500 companies already voluntarily publish sustainability reports, demonstrating that heavy-handed government intervention is unnecessary. We should continue allowing market forces and consumer preferences to drive corporate climate transparency rather than imposing rigid one-size-fits-all mandates. As long as companies aren't lying or misleading the public, they should have flexibility in what environmental data they choose to track and report.",2,1,1,1
,Internet access should be considered a basic human right,"Internet access should undoubtedly be considered a fundamental human right in today's digital age. In an increasingly interconnected world, the internet has become an indispensable tool for communication, education, economic opportunity, and access to essential services and information. To deny individuals access to the internet is to cut them off from these vital resources and put them at a severe disadvantage.
 From applying for jobs to accessing government services, participating in democracy to connecting with friends and family, the internet has become central to nearly every aspect of modern life. It empowers individuals with knowledge, skills, and opportunities that can lift them out of poverty. For many, it is their primary means of education, socialization, and self-expression. Lack of internet access therefore undermines other basic human rights.
 What's more, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown into sharp relief the critical importance of internet connectivity, as work, school, healthcare, and social interaction have been forced to move largely online. Those without reliable internet access have been excluded from these essential spheres of life. This digital divide threatens to exacerbate existing inequalities.
 Just as access to food, water, shelter, and basic education are widely regarded as human rights, so too should access to the internet, as it has become just as crucial to human dignity, well-being and participation in society. Governments and organizations must work to make universal internet access a reality and protect people's fundamental right to connect, communicate, and improve their lives in the digital age.",3,3,3,3
